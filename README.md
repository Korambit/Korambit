## 🖥️ About

I build low-level tooling and UI systems with a focus on Windows internals, performance, and clean aesthetics.

Projects range from:

structured Roblox tooling

custom UI / visual frameworks

Windows quality-of-life utilities

Everything is designed to be minimal, intentional, and sharply organized.

## 🧩 Project Structure

Roblox Tooling
Executor, UI frameworks, and experimental systems related to Roblox development. These projects are structured, versioned, and kept isolated from OS-level tooling.

Windows Tooling
Quality-of-life utilities, automation scripts, and visual customization tools focused on improving workflow and aesthetics at the OS level.

Archived / Experimental
Proof-of-concepts, deprecated experiments, and legacy ideas kept for reference but no longer actively maintained.

## ⚙️ Focus Areas

Low-level Windows internals

UI systems & aesthetic tooling

Lua & C++ interoperability

Clean repo architecture

Performance-first design

## 📌 Notes

Some repositories are private, experimental, or archived

Public releases are intentional, not exhaustive

Feedback-driven releases when projects reach a polished state
